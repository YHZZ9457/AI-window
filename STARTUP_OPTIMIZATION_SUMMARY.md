# Startup Performance Optimization Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Transparent Window Configuration**
- **Before**: Window was configured with `"transparent": true` and `"backgroundColor": "#00000000" (fully transparent)
- **After**: Window configured with `"transparent": false` and `"backgroundColor": "#ffffff"` (solid white background)

### 2. **CSS Transparency Overrides**
- Removed full transparency from minimal mode
- Changed from `background: transparent !important` to `background: var(--bg-glass) !important` (semi-transparent glass effect)

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- Added `optimize_startup_performance()` function
- Window now shows immediately on startup
- Reduced transparency-related rendering overhead

## Configuration Changes

### Tauri Configuration (`tauri.conf.json`)
```json
{
  "transparent": false,
  "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
```

### CSS Updates
- Changed minimal mode from fully transparent to semi-transparent glass effect
- Improved visual consistency while maintaining the floating appearance

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Faster Startup**: No more transparent window initialization delays
2. **Better Responsiveness**: Immediate window display without transparency calculations
3. **Reduced CPU/GPU Load**: Solid backgrounds are less resource-intensive than transparency effects

## How to Test

1. Run the application using `npm run build` followed by the Tauri executable
2. Observe that the window appears immediately without the transparent frame
3. Verify that the application feels more responsive

## Notes

- The application still supports minimal mode with a semi-transparent glass effect
- Full transparency has been removed to eliminate startup performance bottlenecks
- The floating chat appearance is preserved with improved performance
